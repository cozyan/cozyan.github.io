> Extrasensory perception means that you can perceive things that are not immediately available in space or time (Engber). 

From my personal experience, when I was a high school student, we had a final exam at the end of the semester. One of my friends, whom I'll call A, told me she dreamed that another student, B, had secured first place in our Math final exam. I didn’t believe her dream, of course, and responded, "Dreams are different. If you dreamed that B would get first place, then it probably won’t happen in reality." However, an interesting thing occurred. When the math teacher announced the results, he revealed that the first place in the final math exam went to student B. This experience of ESP I had since my friend A's perception that B would get the first place just by dreaming seemed ridiculous. Sometimes, people’s ESP experiences can also be explained by perceptual set, which is a set of mental tendencies and assumptions that greatly affect what we perceive (Myers 223). In other words, context effects can also explain why we might have extrasensory perceptions. We perceive different perceptions based on a given stimulus, which is due to our differing perceptual sets (Myers 224). Therefore, what we perceive may not be the truth.

In 2008, an article titled “Neuroimaging fails to demonstrate ESP is real” was published. In this article, the author states that although research fails to demonstrate that ESP is real, they cannot prove that ESP is not real. In other words, we cannot be sure that ESP can be proven as real. Researchers developed a new method to study ESP. Scientists used brain scanning to test whether individuals have knowledge that cannot be explained through normal perceptual processing (Lavoie). There are two types of visual stimuli in this newly developed method. One is ESP stimuli and the other is non-ESP stimuli. These two types of stimuli were identical except one, the ESP stimuli, which were presented not only visually but also telepathically, clairvoyantly, and precognitively to participants (Lavoie). The results show that scientists cannot affirm the null hypothesis that ESP exists by testing telepathically and precognitively using different methods, which is the best evidence to date against the existence of ESP (Lavoie).

However, in 2017, a published article stated that ESP is real, countering the conclusion found in 2008 that ESP cannot be proved real. Daryl Bem, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a social psychologist who has researched ESP and psi phenomena for over twenty years, has conducted various experiments to test whether ESP exists. One finding is that people's guesses cannot be dismissed as mere random guessing. Bem conducted an experiment to test whether hidden images would be arousing to students (Engber). He also conducted several similar experiments with the sequence of tasks and stimuli reversed, which showed that students could have their emotions primed by words they hadn’t seen (Engber). He conducted tests with a thousand subjects, nine experiments, and obtained eight significant results in 2010. His conclusion shows that ESP actually exists and there is a small but significant improvement over random guessing. He suggests that ESP would likely be attuned to our most ancient needs and drives (Engber).

In my opinion, I think extrasensory perception does exist in the world, but there are strong and weak forms of ESP hidden within our bodies (Engber). Most of us have weak ESP, making it very difficult for researchers to find convincing evidence to prove that ESP exists since it is not easy to find strong evidence from most of us who only have a weak relationship with ESP. However, there are small minorities who do have strong ESP, presenting telepathically, clairvoyantly, and precognitively, which differ from the norm (Lavoie). Therefore, although ESP does exist, scientists do not have sufficient and convincing evidence to prove the existence of ESP.
