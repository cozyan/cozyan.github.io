Recently, I came across a piece of news: the richest man in India held a wedding for his son. The guests were innumerable, the extravagance blinding—it was, without exaggeration, a modern-day royal spectacle. What surprised me was not the grandeur or the wastefulness, but rather the sight beyond the wedding: in the streets and alleys, countless ragged people stood watching, clapping and cheering, their eyes filled with envy and reverence.

I sat by the window. Outside, the early March wind was still cool. As I thought of these images, a chill crept over my heart. In a nation, the coldest thing is not snow, nor poverty, but when the poor are unaware of their poverty—when they mistake the glory of the rich as their own blessing.

India, this ancient land—I am no expert. But from what I’ve read of its history, I know it is a country rich in culture and spirit. Yet, its millennia-old caste system weighs as heavily as a mountain. How could such a structure be undone in a single day? Under this system, people are categorized as if labeled goods. To be born a human being is not enough—one is born with status. If a person is never told from cradle to grave, “You are worthy too,” then they will come to regard their own lowliness as natural.

The rich flaunt, the poor applaud—this is not the first time we've seen this grotesque display. If this is a victory of capitalism, then it was won far too easily—so easily it becomes horrifying. Wealth, like water, ought to nourish everything quietly. Yet now, it builds high walls and only irrigates the heights. Those below, gazing up at the drops running down the wall, believe it to be divine grace.

I think of Mr. Lu Xun, who once said, “The sorrows of humanity are not shared.” But I would add: sometimes, human folly is shared all too easily. When the rich no longer feel shame in flaunting their wealth, and the poor no longer feel dignity in their poverty—when the robbed cheer for the robbers, when the oppressed defend their oppression—then this society, no matter how radiant on the surface, is nothing more than a gilded theatre: glorious on stage, but beneath the floorboards lies buried dignity.

In China’s long history, tyranny often met with rebellion. We may not glorify violence, but at the very least, those people knew what was unjust. They knew they had the right to refuse fate. But in today’s world—and not just in India—people are shaped by media, numbed by desire, lulled into obedience by something called “hope.”

Thinking of this, I looked out the window. Not far away, an old locust tree stood silently in the wind. It did not speak, but I seemed to hear it sigh.

This world does not lack poverty.
What it lacks is clarity.
More than that, it lacks the **courage that comes after clarity.**
