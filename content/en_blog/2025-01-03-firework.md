That day, the town was abuzz. Word had spread—there were posters on the power poles: the tycoon’s son's wedding would be broadcast live on the big screen in the town square. Everyone headed there, saying, “If you don’t watch it, you’re not one of us.” Li the Cripple went too, hobbling along on his cane, chewing some leftover betel nut from two days ago, spitting out a mouthful of red-stained phlegm.

“My goodness, that’s real luxury,” shouted Aunt Zhang from next door. “The bride’s dress weighed over 300 jin—it’s all stitched with gold, they say it jingled with every step!”

Li nodded. He didn’t quite understand the word “gown,” but he knew gold was worth money. Last time he got sick, he didn’t even have money for painkillers. He thought, *If just one piece of that gold fell off, I could live for a whole month.*

The screen lit up—the broadcast began. The lights on the screen were so bright they hurt the eyes. The tycoon’s son came out dressed like a king, followed by a troupe of dancers. Even foreign celebrities were there, nodding and shaking to the music. The audience burst into applause, a wave of clapping like wind over wheat fields.

Li clapped along. Slowly, because his hands trembled, but he still clapped. He didn’t know what he was applauding for—just that everyone else was. If he didn’t clap, someone might call him backward.

“They say the whole wedding cost five billion!” a young man squeezed through the crowd, shouting. “Even the Prime Minister went to give his blessings!”

“That’s skill right there!” Aunt Zhang cut in. “If someone can earn that much, it means they’re smart.”

Li listened, feeling dizzy. He thought of last month’s electricity bill—it had gone up 20%, citing “rising grid costs.” He only had one hanging lightbulb, connected through a borrowed line from the neighbor. That week, he didn’t dare turn on the light. He ate by the moonlight through his window.

But he still clapped.

At the end of the wedding, there were fireworks—burst after burst on the screen, like flowers blooming in the sky. The crowd erupted with joy. Children clapped, adults recorded videos, even dogs barked in excitement.

Li looked up at the fireworks on the screen. His lips twitched, like a smile. He suddenly remembered when their town used to have fireworks, back when they opened a factory. He was young then, had a job, had food, had lights. He looked down at his worn-out shoes and felt the fireworks were very far away—so far they belonged to another world.

“Beautiful, isn’t it,” Aunt Zhang said again.

Li nodded. “Mm, real bright.”

He didn’t say that the brightness was blinding. His vision was a little blurry. The light had forced tears from his eyes.

He wiped them and kept clapping—louder this time. He didn’t dare stop. He feared someone next to him would ask: “Why aren’t you clapping?”

He thought for a moment and clapped twice more, saying: “Rich folks are something else.”

That night, after the wedding broadcast ended, Li couldn’t sleep. He kept hearing clapping in his ears, as if countless hands were slapping inside his skull. He buried his head in his pillow, trying to sleep, but the image of the golden dress and the words “electricity price hike” wouldn’t stop replaying.

The next day, he went to the market as usual to scavenge for discarded vegetables. He ran into Old Feng.

Old Feng used to be an electrician—got laid off years ago. People said he used to work at the power plant, one of those who used their brain. But he had a sharp tongue, criticized the higher-ups, and got screwed for it. Now he survives by fixing kettles and changing lightbulbs for rice.

“Did you watch the fireworks yesterday?” Li asked, trying to make conversation.

Old Feng was fixing a broken desk lamp. He didn’t look up, just grunted.

“I saw it,” Li forced a smile. “Livelier than New Year’s.”

“Yeah.” This time Feng looked up, eyes like shattered glass. “You know how much each firework cost?”

Li shook his head.

“Two million rupees each. That’s about two hundred thousand RMB,” Feng said. “And you know how much your electricity bill went up?”

“Over twenty yuan,” Li replied.

“Mhm.” Feng smiled bitterly, like spitting phlegm. “Your whole month’s lighting bill could buy them **one second** of fireworks.”

Li said nothing. He felt a strange kind of hunger—not from his stomach, but like acid rising from his gut. He looked at his hand—it was still sore from clapping the night before.

“So what do you call this?” he finally asked.

Old Feng handed the repaired lamp to a customer, stood up, and dusted off his pants. “This?” he said, “This is called modern civilization.”

“Back in the day, we cursed emperors for being extravagant. Now the emperors are gone, replaced by ‘entrepreneurs,’ ‘tycoons.’ But can you still curse them?”

Li shook his head. He didn’t even dare share anything online.

“Criticize them and you’re called a hater. Refuse to clap and they say you’re bitter. One day when you starve, they’ll say it’s because ‘you didn’t work hard enough.’” Old Feng lit a cigarette and took a deep drag, like swallowing the bitterness of the entire age.

“So what do we do?” Li finally asked.

“I don’t know,” Feng said. “Sometimes I want to shout, but no one listens. Sometimes I don’t want to shout anymore, but I’m afraid I’ve already become what they want—kneeling, smiling, clapping.”

He stubbed out the cigarette and smiled faintly. “But you asking means your head’s still warm. Don’t let it go cold. Don’t end up like me—cold to the core.”

Li was stunned for a long time, then nodded. That day, he didn’t go back to scavenge. He sat in his room, staring at the electric meter. The numbers ticked upward, one by one—like a knife, never drawn, but always there.

He didn’t clap anymore.  
But he didn’t know what to raise instead.

After that day, Li grew quiet. He stopped going to the square, stopped joining crowds. When the TV played success stories or entrepreneurial legends, he didn’t look. He started asking questions:  
“Do you know how electricity prices are set?” he asked the vegetable vendor.  
“Has your wage ever gone up?” he asked the barber.  
“Do you think life will ever turn around?” he asked Old Feng.

At first, no one answered. Later, some people got angry.

“Quit being a downer—we’re living just fine, what are you complaining about?”

“Life’s hard for everyone. That tycoon made his money fair and square. He’s smart.”

Li no longer argued. He just took note—of who didn’t want to hear pain anymore, of who had fully become “their audience.”

Old Feng still talked to him occasionally. But it felt more like two refugees in the ruins confirming: “You’re still here?” “Yeah. You too?”

One day, a team came from higher up, to promote “electricity reform.” They set up booths in the square, hung banners saying *“Building a Better Future Together”* and *“Tycoons Are Workers Too.”* They gave out free bread. People flocked to grab it, praising, “The government finally cares about us!”

Li stood outside the crowd, watching them eat bread and wave signs reading *“Support Market Efficiency.”* He wanted to laugh—but couldn’t. He wanted to shout—but his throat had gone hoarse.

“You going?” Old Feng asked, walking up beside him.

“No,” Li said. “They’re feeding us the corpse of tomorrow.”

Old Feng grunted. “Me neither.”

Two days later, Feng was reported—for “spreading negative speech.” They took him away. No one knew where.

Li went looking. He asked several police stations—they all said they didn’t know. He returned to his room. The electricity had been cut off. The bill said he had been “intentionally delinquent.”

That night, he lit a candle. Its flame flickered on the wall.

He thought: *This light feels more real than the big screen in the square.*

He took out a piece of paper and wrote something on it. No name. Just one sentence:

**“If you are applauding, please feel your palms—see if they’re bleeding.”**

The next morning, the paper appeared on the town gate wall.

By noon, it was torn down.

No one admitted to seeing it.  
No one wanted to admit they had once applauded.

Li vanished.  
Some said he went to another town.  
Some said he jumped into the river.  
Most stopped mentioning him.

Everything returned to normal.

The screen in the square lit up again, playing a documentary about the new generation of tycoons.

The title was: **“They Made Our Lives Better.”**

The crowd applauded again.

Their clapping was neat. Loud.

As if nothing had ever happened.
