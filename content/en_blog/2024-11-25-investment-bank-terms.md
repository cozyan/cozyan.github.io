Recently, I had the fortune to attend a gathering in the data industry, where I met many professionals primarily from data-related fields. Among them, I had a deep conversation with a female executive from Goldman Sachs who introduced me to many fundamental aspects of investment banking, from which I gained immensely.

Firstly, the operations of an investment bank can broadly be divided into front office and back office. The front office staff, like the executive I spoke with, are directly involved in managing funds and client interactions. They are the main source of the bank's revenue, directly participating in securities trading and asset management. The back office, on the other hand, supports roles including risk management, technical support, and compliance, ensuring the smooth running of front office operations.

Another important distinction in investment banking is between the buy-side and the sell-side. The buy-side represents clients in making investments and managing their funds to maximize returns. Although investment banks assist clients with investments, ultimately, the clients themselves must bear the profits and losses. The sell-side, however, focuses on helping clients issue stocks or bonds, including pricing and market sales. This distinction is crucial for understanding how investment banks operate and earn profits. It's noteworthy that because of potential insider information, she at Goldman Sachs cannot invest in stocks herself. However, she can invest in index funds or other broadly diversified investment products, such as mutual funds or ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), because these are considered low-risk broad market investments, unlikely to involve specific insider information.

During our discussion, I raised a question: Can clients bypass investment banks to issue stocks directly? The answer is, this is nearly impossible. Investment banks play an irreplaceable role in helping clients price and reach potential investors. Without the help of an investment bank, most companies would not be able to effectively enter the capital market.

Like any other industry, there is fierce competition among investment banks. Each bank tries to attract and retain clients by offering better services and more attractive transaction conditions. Fundamentally, investment banks are service industries; their revenues mainly come from transaction commissions and service fees.

Our conversation also touched on ESG investing, an investment strategy that focuses on environmental, social, and governance factors. With increasing global attention on sustainable development, ESG investing has become an undeniable trend in the capital markets. The executive specifically mentioned that even China's electric vehicle market is part of ESG investing.

She mentioned that although there are data engineers and data scientists in the team, their main tasks are still to analyze and support the business to facilitate better investment decisions. Thus, their roles are relatively marginalized, primarily supporting others' decisions.
