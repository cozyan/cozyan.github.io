> "When freedom becomes the right to self-destruction, and dignity is sold as a lifestyle choice, progress is nothing but a beautifully wrapped collapse."

We are living in an era of high civilization, yet one that feels increasingly hollow.  
Technology is advancing rapidly, slogans are becoming prettier, and society appears to be more “free” than ever—marijuana is legal, surrogacy is legal, the sex industry is now considered a “legitimate profession,” and stories of people getting rich overnight on OnlyFans are celebrated as a new wave of female empowerment. It seems the world is moving toward a brighter future.

But where are we really headed?

This so-called "freedom" is increasingly looking like **freedom to fall**—you can legally destroy your body, legally rent out your womb, legally turn yourself into a product, legally numb your mind and descend into apathy. And all of it is sold to us under the banners of "progress," "modernity," and "personal choice." If you don’t buy into it, you’re accused of being "narrow-minded."

But does freedom really mean **everything is for sale**? Shouldn’t freedom be about giving people more dignity and possibility, not handing over their lives to the market to be processed and sold?

Surrogacy is one of the most brutal examples.  
Once upon a time, childbirth was sacred, deeply personal. Now it’s a contractual transaction, priced and regulated. Clients pick the "best eggs," the "best wombs." The surrogate endures the injections, the hormones, the tearing, the trauma. And if the child is born with problems? They might be rejected like a defective product.  
Yet the bystanders say: “Well, it's her choice. She’s getting paid.”  
But what they don't see is this: **when the most painful biological labor is rationalized as a free-market decision, we’ve already abandoned the last shred of human dignity.**

And often, those standing at the top believe they’ll never be the ones selling their womb, or their body, or their privacy.  
They say, “Hey, we all work. We’re all being exploited.”  
But they don’t truly empathize with the pain of those below. They use this rhetoric to excuse their apathy. And if one day they become wealthy, they might not hesitate to **become the consumer**—because they never saw the world from the other side.

Meanwhile, short videos and digital content bombard our brains day and night, robbing us of our ability to think.  
People keep scrolling, reacting, consuming—no longer reading, no longer reflecting. They become pale, foggy versions of themselves. Their minds are empty. Their hearts, hollow.  
These people, now reduced to reactive consumers, become voters in democratic systems—but what do they vote for? They elect those who shout the loudest, not those who think the deepest.

This is the **real-life version of “Amusing Ourselves to Death.”**  
Yes, democracy still exists. But the public mind has been so dulled, so addicted to fast content and emotional sugar, that their will is no longer truly their own. Voting becomes an elegant manipulation.  
“Public opinion” becomes a product of algorithms.

Behind this all is a **precise machinery of exploitation.** It no longer needs violence. It uses “freedom” and “choice” to lull you into obedience, until you walk willingly into the abyss.  
The scariest part? More and more people believe this is “progress.”

Perhaps we’re already sliding into a world like that in *The Three-Body Problem*—a seemingly advanced, yet spiritually barren “Dark Forest.”  
Everyone protects themselves in silence, no one dares to look upward, to dream, to question.  
They cling to their little pleasures, and abandon the distant light.

But I know—some still think.  
Some still ask, “Is this really freedom?”

As long as someone is asking, we haven’t lost.  
Even if the times demand our silence, we can still write, create, and speak—  
To protect that last spark of clarity.

Not to save the world,  
But simply to remind each other: **we are still alive, not domesticated.**
