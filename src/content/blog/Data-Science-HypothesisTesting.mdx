# `2` - Hypothesis Testing

Ref: [Lesson9_HypTests (colorado.edu)](https://www.colorado.edu/amath/sites/default/files/attached-files/lesson9_hyptests.pdf)

Statistical hypothesis: a claim about the value of a parameter or population characteristic.

Components of a Hypothesis Test

1. Formulate the hypothesis to be tested.
2. Determine the appropriate test statistic and
   calculate it using the sample data.
3. Comparison of test statistic to critical region to
   draw initial conclusions.
4. Calculation of p-value.
5. Conclusion, written in terms of the original
   problem

<Latex formula='E=mc^2' />

Here is the code for the above formula:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3], 'b': [4, 5, 6]})
```

Here is a sample mermaid diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

Here is the inline code block `import pandas as pd`.
